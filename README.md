# Newmark_beta-Newton_Raphson
Solved a 5 dofs system with Newmark Beta time stepping and Newton Raphson method to solve for a friction Non-linearity (Jenkins Elements)
Run Newmark_MDF_patterns_in_time_v3.m, the rest are companion functions for that main function. Scroll through the section in the main function code and search for Newton-Raphson to see that part only.
